# Zephyr RTOS Console Echo App

This repository is a simple Console Echo application written in [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org).

The files are configured to be built on [PlatformIO](platformio.org/) and simulated on a HiFive1 board in [Renode](https://renode.io/).

The intent is to be a companion to the article <https://www.zephyrproject.org/developing-zephyr-rtos-embedded-applications-on-platformio-and-simulating-on-antmicro-renode/>.
